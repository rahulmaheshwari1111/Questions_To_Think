// Consider the following code. What will the output be, and why?

(function () {
    try {

    } catch (x) {
        var x = 1, y = 2;

    console.log(x);
    console.log(y);
})();


// 1
// undefined
// 2
// var statements are hoisted (without their value initialization) to the top of the global or function scope it belongs to, 
// even when it’s inside a with or catch block. However, the error’s identifier is only visible inside the catch block. It is equivalent to:

(function () {
    var x, y; // outer and hoisted
    try {
        throw new Error();
    } catch (x /* inner */) {
        x = 1; // inner x, not the outer one
        y = 2; // there is only one y, which is in the outer scope
        console.log(x /* inner */);
    }
    console.log(x);
    console.log(y);
})();

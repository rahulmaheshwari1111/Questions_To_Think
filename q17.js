// What do the following lines output, and why?

console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
console.log(3 > 2 > 1);



// The first statement returns true which is as expected.

// The second returns false because of how the engine works regarding operator associativity for < and >. 
// It compares left to right, so 3 > 2 > 1 JavaScript translates to true > 1. 
// true has value 1, so it then compares 1 > 1, which is false.

// What will the following code output and why?

var b = 1;
function outer(){
   	var b = 2
    function inner(){
        b++;
        var b = 3;
        console.log(b)
    }
    inner();
}
outer();


// Output to the console will be “3”.

// There are three closures in the example, each with it’s own var b declaration. When a variable is invoked closures will be checked in order from local to global until an instance is found. Since the inner closure has a b variable of its own, that is what will be output.

// Furthermore, due to hoisting the code in inner will be interpreted as follows:

function inner () {
    var b; // b is undefined
    b++; // b is NaN
    b = 3; // b is 3
    console.log(b); // output "3"
}
